		+ Non-invasive cerebral angiography (NICA) or other imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT) within the past year
4. **Imaging Requirements**:
	* Carotid ultrasound must be performed at least every 12 months to monitor plaque progression
	* NICA or other imaging modalities may be required if symptoms worsen or if conservative treatment fails
5. **Severity Criteria**:
	* Patients with a score of ≥3 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≥2 are eligible for CEA

**Medical Necessity Criteria**

To determine medical necessity, we consider the following criteria:

		+ Recent TIA or stroke
		+ Severe carotid stenosis (>70%)
		+ Diabetes or hypertension
2. **Failed Prior Treatments**:

	* Severe cardiovascular disease
4. **Lack of Conservative Treatment**: CEA is not covered if the patient has not attempted and failed conservative treatment for at least 12 weeks.
5. **Cosmetic Indications**: CEA is not covered for patients with cosmetic indications, such as:

	* Completed within the past 30 days
	* Includes a thorough review of systems and neurological examination
2. **Diagnostic Test Results**:
	* Carotid ultrasound results from within the past 6 months
	* NICA or other imaging modalities results from within the past year
3. **Treatment Logs**:
	* Records of conservative treatment attempted and duration
4. **Specialist Consultations**:
	* Neurosurgery consultation to confirm diagnosis and determine medical necessity

**Authorization Details**
