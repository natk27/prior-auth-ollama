Varicose vein treatment with sclerotherapy and compression therapy is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat varicose veins, which are enlarged, twisted veins that can cause discomfort, pain, and swelling in the legs. This procedure involves injecting a solution into the affected vein to close it off, followed by the application of compression therapy to help reduce swelling and promote healing.
