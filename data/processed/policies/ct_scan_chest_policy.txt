PRIOR AUTHORIZATION POLICY
======================================================================

Procedure: CT Scan Chest
CPT Code: 71250

======================================================================

**INSURANCE prior authorization policy**

**PROCEDURE OVERVIEW**

 Procedure Name: CT Scan Chest (CPT Code: 71250)
 Clinical Description:
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the chest and lungs. This procedure is used to diagnose and monitor conditions such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism.

**COVERAGE CRITERIA**

To be covered by insurance, the following criteria must be met:

1. Conservative treatment: The patient must have undergone at least 12 weeks of physical therapy, including:
   - A minimum of 2 sessions per week for 24 weeks
   - Each session to include exercises and stretches targeted at improving chest mobility and strength
   - Progress tracking through a standardized log

2. Symptom duration: The patient's symptoms must have persisted for a minimum of 6 weeks.

3. Clinical documentation required:
   - A detailed medical history, including any previous chest complaints or injuries
   - Results from the most recent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), if performed within the past 12 months
   - Referral from a primary care physician, specifying the need for a CT scan of the chest

4. Imaging requirements:
   - The patient must be clinically unstable and require rapid imaging to guide treatment decisions.
   - The imaging provider must have documented evidence that conservative management has failed.

5. Severity criteria:
   - Pain scores on a scale of 6 or higher, as measured by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
   - Decreased lung function, as indicated by a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) below 80% predicted

**MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA**

To determine medical necessity for this procedure:

1. Patient selection criteria:
   - Patients with respiratory symptoms and signs of pulmonary disease
   - Those who have not responded to conservative treatment or require rapid diagnosis due to clinical instability

2. Failed prior treatments:
   - Previous episodes of pneumonia that required hospitalization or prolonged IV antibiotic therapy
   - Failure to respond to bronchodilator therapy or oxygen saturation <92% on room air

3. Contraindications to conservative care:
   - Patients with severe comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   - Those who require high-intensity oxygen therapy (>60% FiO2)

**EXCLUSION CRITERIA**

The following exclusions apply:

1. Active infections:
   - Patients with confirmed or suspected acute bacterial pneumonia
   - Those with a fever >38°C (100.4°F) or white blood cell count (WBC) >15,000 cells/μL

2. Pregnancy:
   - Pregnant women require additional evaluation and monitoring prior to ordering imaging.

3. Severe comorbidities:
   - Patients with severe cardiovascular disease or ESRD
   - Those with severe COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization

4. Lack of conservative treatment:
   - Failure to complete required physical therapy sessions within the allotted timeframe

5. Cosmetic indications:
   - Imaging ordered for cosmetic purposes, such as documenting scarring or assessing chest wall deformity.

**DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

The following documentation is required:

1. History and physical examination:
   - A thorough review of systems and clinical examination findings
   - Current vital signs and laboratory results

2. Diagnostic test results:
   - Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
   - Chest X-ray or CT scan images
   - Laboratory results, including blood counts, electrolytes, and creatinine levels

3. Treatment logs:
   - Physical therapy sessions completed, including dates and duration of each session

4. Specialist consultations:
   - Referrals from primary care physicians and specialist consultants, such as pulmonologists or cardiologists

**AUTHORIZATION DETAILS**

* Valid for: 90 days from the date of authorization
* Requires peer-to-peer if denied.

If the insurance company denies coverage after thorough review of this prior authorization policy, a peer-to-peer review must be conducted between two medical professionals to reevaluate the decision and ensure accurate communication with patients.
