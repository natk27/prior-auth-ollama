### 1. PROCEDURE OVERVIEW

*   **Full Procedure Name:** Transthoracic Echocardiogram with Doppler
*   **CPT Code(s):** 93306 (Echocardiography, transthoracic, real-time with image documentation (2D), includes M-mode recording, when performed, complete with spectral Doppler echocardiography, and color flow Doppler echocardiography)
*   **Brief Clinical Description:** A non-invasive ultrasound procedure that uses sound waves to create moving images of the heart. It provides detailed information about the heart's size, shape, pumping function, and the condition of the heart valves, as well as blood flow through the heart chambers and valves. This complete study includes 2D imaging, M-mode, spectral Doppler, and color flow Doppler.

### 3. MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA

The echocardiogram must be medically necessary based on one or more of the following clinical scenarios:

*   **Evaluation of Suspected Valvular Heart Disease:**
    *   New systolic or diastolic murmur, or significant change in a known murmur.
    *   Signs or symptoms of valvular dysfunction (e.g., dyspnea, syncope, chest pain) with suspicion of stenosis or regurgitation.
    *   Known history of valvular heart disease requiring assessment for progression or complications (e.g., prosthetic valve evaluation, endocarditis surveillance).
*   **Evaluation of Suspected Heart Failure or Cardiomyopathy:**
    *   Clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, edema) with supportive EKG or CXR findings.
    *   Elevated cardiac biomarkers (BNP/NT-proBNP) in the setting of suspected heart failure.
    *   Family history of cardiomyopathy warranting screening in symptomatic individuals.
*   **Assessment of Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction or Complications:**
    *   Evaluation of regional wall motion abnormalities in the setting of suspected or known acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocardial infarction (MI) where other imaging is not definitive or contraindicated.
    *   Assessment for mechanical complications of MI (e.g., ventricular septal defect, papillary muscle rupture).
*   **Evaluation of Pericardial Disease:**
    *   Suspected pericardial effusion, tamponade, or constrictive pericarditis based on clinical signs, symptoms, EKG, or CXR findings.
*   **Evaluation of Cardiac Masses or Sources of Embolism:**
    *   Suspicion of cardiac tumor, thrombus, or other mass based on clinical presentation or other imaging findings (e.g., stroke of unknown origin, systemic embolism).
*   **Evaluation of Pulmonary Hypertension:**
    *   Clinical suspicion of pulmonary hypertension with supportive findings from EKG, CXR, or other non-invasive tests.
*   **Evaluation of Aortic Disease:**
    *   Suspected aortic dissection or aneurysm in specific clinical settings where other imaging is inconclusive or not feasible.
*   **Evaluation of Unexplained Syncope or Presyncope:**
    *   Recurrent, unexplained syncope or presyncope, particularly in the presence of abnormal EKG findings or other cardiac risk factors.
*   **Follow-up for Known Cardiac Conditions:**
    *   Monitoring of known moderate-to-severe valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure with documented significant clinical change or as recommended by established guidelines for specific conditions (e.g., annual or bi-annual for specific severities, *not* within 12 months for stable conditions without change).

### 4. EXCLUSION CRITERIA (If any of these criteria are met, authorization will be denied)

Authorization for CPT code 93306 will be denied for, but not limited to, the following indications:

*   **Routine Screening:** Routine screening in asymptomatic individuals without any documented cardiac risk factors, abnormal physical exam findings, or prior diagnostic abnormalities.
*   **Pre-Operative Evaluation:** Routine pre-operative screening for non-cardiac surgery in asymptomatic individuals deemed low-risk for cardiac complications, unless specific guidelines for high-risk surgical patients recommend it.
*   **Repeat Echocardiogram (Frequency):**
    *   Repeat echocardiogram within **12 months** of a prior complete echocardiogram for stable, chronic cardiac conditions (e.g., stable congestive heart failure, stable valvular heart disease, stable cardiomyopathy) in the absence of documented significant clinical change, worsening symptoms, or a change in management plan.
    *   Repeat echocardiogram within **3 months** of a prior complete echocardiogram for any reason, unless there is an acute and significant change in clinical status, or new, emergent symptoms that warrant immediate re-evaluation.
*   **Lack of Prior Diagnostic Workup:** Absence of a detailed history and physical examination, EKG, or other appropriate initial diagnostic evaluation as specified in Section 2, unless the clinical scenario is acute and requires immediate evaluation (e.g., suspected acute tamponade).
*   **Cosmetic or Research Indications:** Ordered solely for cosmetic purposes, research protocols, or in the absence of clear medical necessity.
*   **Insufficient Documentation:** Lack of comprehensive clinical documentation to support medical necessity according to the criteria outlined in this policy.
