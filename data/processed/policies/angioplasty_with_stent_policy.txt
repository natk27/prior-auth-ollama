**Policy Number:** MED-CARD-0012
**Effective Date:** January 1, 2024
**Review Date:** October 1, 2023

---

### 1. PROCEDURE OVERVIEW

*   **Full Procedure Name:** Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) with Intracoronary Stent Placement (Single Major Coronary Artery or Branch)
*   **CPT Code(s):** 92928 (Percutaneous transcatheter coronary angioplasty with stent placement, single major coronary artery or branch; without drug-eluting stent)
    *   *Note: Other CPT codes may apply for multiple vessels, different types of stents (e.g., drug-eluting stents), or specific interventions like atherectomy. This policy specifically addresses 92928.*
*   **Brief Clinical Description:** Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) with stent placement is a minimally invasive procedure performed to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries, typically caused by atherosclerosis (plaque buildup), and to maintain patency using a metallic scaffold (stent). The procedure involves inserting a catheter into an artery (usually in the groin or wrist), guiding it to the coronary arteries, inflating a balloon to compress the plaque, and then deploying a stent to hold the artery open. This procedure aims to improve blood flow to the heart muscle, alleviate symptoms of angina, and prevent cardiac events in eligible patients.

### 2. COVERAGE CRITERIA (All criteria listed below must be met for authorization)

    *   The patient has undergone a minimum of **3 months (12 weeks)** of documented optimal medical therapy (OMT) including, but not limited to:

### 3. MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA

In addition to the coverage criteria above, the procedure must meet the following medical necessity criteria:

*   **Patient Selection Criteria:**
    *   Patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) who have persistent angina or anginal equivalents despite optimal medical therapy.
    *   Patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndromes (Unstable Angina, NSTEMI, STEMI) where urgent revascularization is indicated according to current clinical guidelines.
    *   Patients with significant objective evidence of myocardial ischemia and symptoms attributable to that ischemia.
    *   Patients with a high-risk non-invasive stress test that indicates a large area of myocardium at risk (e.g., left main equivalent stenosis, severe multi-vessel disease, or extensive ischemia with poor exercise tolerance).

*   **Failed Prior Treatments:**
    *   Documented failure of an adequate trial (minimum of **3 months**) of optimal medical therapy to control symptoms of stable angina.
    *   OR documented intolerance or contraindication to components of optimal medical therapy.
    *   *Note: This criterion does not apply to patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndromes requiring emergent intervention.*

*   **Contraindications to Conservative Care (where applicable):**
    *   Rapidly accelerating symptoms of angina (crescendo angina) despite escalating medical therapy.
    *   High-risk anatomical features identified on non-invasive imaging (e.g., significant Left Main Coronary Artery stenosis, severe proximal LAD stenosis) that warrant revascularization despite minimal symptoms, or in conjunction with symptoms.
    *   Life-threatening arrhythmias directly attributable to myocardial ischemia.

### 4. EXCLUSION CRITERIA (The procedure will NOT be covered if any of the following are present)

*   **Lack of Conservative Treatment:** For stable angina, no documented attempt at optimal medical therapy and lifestyle modification for the required duration (unless contraindicated or emergent ACS).
*   **Asymptomatic Patients:** Without objective evidence of significant ischemia on non-invasive or invasive testing.
*   **Non-Significant Stenosis:** Visually estimated coronary artery stenosis of less than 50% for Left Main Coronary Artery or less than 70% for other major epicardial arteries, AND without objective evidence of functional significance (FFR > 0.80 or iFR > 0.89).
*   **Diffuse, Small Vessel Disease:** Coronary anatomy not amenable to successful stenting due to diffuse disease, severe calcification, extreme tortuosity, or very small vessel size (<2.0mm diameter) with a high likelihood of poor outcomes.
*   **Severe Comorbidities:**
    *   Uncontrolled active systemic infection (e.g., sepsis, active endocarditis).
    *   Severe, uncompensated heart failure (NYHA Class IV) not primarily due to ischemia, with poor prognosis for improvement post-PCI.
    *   Severe bleeding diathesis or active gastrointestinal bleeding not controlled.
    *   End-stage renal disease (ESRD) with severe multi-organ dysfunction, or other severe comorbidities (e.g., metastatic cancer with expected life expectancy less than **6 months**) where the risks of the procedure clearly outweigh the potential benefits.
*   **Pregnancy:** Relative contraindication due to radiation exposure; intervention considered only if life-threatening for the mother and fetal risks are thoroughly discussed and documented.
*   **Cosmetic or Prophylactic Indications:** Not covered for primary prevention in asymptomatic individuals without objective evidence of ischemia, or for non-cardiac chest pain.

### 5. DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

The following specific documentation must be submitted with the prior authorization request:

*   **History and Physical Examination:** Comprehensive H&P, including a detailed cardiac history, cardiovascular risk factors, symptom description (onset, duration, frequency, severity using CCS Angina Class), and physical findings (including cardiac and vascular exam).

    *   Relevant laboratory test results (as listed in section 2).
*   **Treatment Logs:** Detailed records of prior medical therapy (medication names, dosages, start/end dates, documented adherence, and patient response or intolerance).
*   **Specialist Consultations:** Consultation notes from the referring cardiologist and/or interventional cardiologist outlining the rationale for the procedure, discussion of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making with the patient.
*   **Cardiac Rehabilitation Records:** If applicable, documentation of participation in or referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs.

### 6. AUTHORIZATION DETAILS

*   **Validity Period:** Approved prior authorizations for CPT 92928 are valid for **90 calendar days** from the date of approval. If the procedure is not performed within this timeframe, a new prior authorization request will be required.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Review:** If a request for prior authorization is initially denied, the requesting provider will be offered the opportunity for a peer-to-peer discussion with a medical director or physician reviewer from the health plan with similar clinical expertise. This discussion must be requested within **5 business days** of the denial notification.
*   **Appeal Rights:** If the prior authorization request is denied after peer-to-peer review (or if peer-to-peer review is declined), the patient and/or their authorized representative have the right to appeal the decision.
