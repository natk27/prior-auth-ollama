**Procedure Overview**

**Appendectomy**
CPT Code: 44970

An appendectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the appendix, which is a small, tube-like structure connected to the large intestine. The procedure is typically performed to treat acute appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix that can lead to perforation and peritonitis.

	* 3 weeks of home exercise program (2 hours per day, 5 days a week)
	* 3 months of follow-up appointments with the treating physician
2. **Symptom Duration Requirements**: Minimum 6 weeks of symptoms of acute appendicitis, including:
	* Abdominal pain that worsens over time

		+ Electrolyte panel within the past 7 days
		+ Imaging studies (e.g., CT scan, ultrasound) within the past 2 weeks
4. **Imaging Requirements**:
	* A non-contrast abdominal CT scan or ultrasound within the past 2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis
5. **Severity Criteria**:
	* Pain scale: ≥ 6/10 on the McNeil pain scale
	* Functional assessment: ≥ 50% decrease in daily activities due to abdominal pain

**Medical Necessity Criteria**

To determine medical necessity, we will consider the following criteria:

1. **Patient Selection Criteria**: The patient must be diagnosed with acute appendicitis and have failed conservative treatment.
2. **Failed Prior Treatments**: The patient must have tried conservative treatment for at least 12 weeks without improvement.
3. **Contraindications to Conservative Care**:
	* Severe comorbidities (e.g., chronic heart disease, diabetes)
	* Active infections (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease)
	* Pregnancy (if applicable)
	* Severe mental health conditions

**Exclusion Criteria**

The following exclusions will apply:

1. **Active Infections**: If the patient has an active infection, we will not cover the appendectomy.
2. **Pregnancy**: If the patient is pregnant, we will not cover the appendectomy unless medically necessary (e.g., suspected perforation).
3. **Severe Comorbidities**: We will not cover the appendectomy if the patient has severe comorbidities that make surgery unnecessary or high-risk.
4. **Lack of Conservative Treatment**: If the patient has not tried conservative treatment for at least 12 weeks without improvement, we will not cover the appendectomy.
5. **Cosmetic Indications**: We will not cover the appendectomy if the procedure is performed solely for cosmetic reasons.
