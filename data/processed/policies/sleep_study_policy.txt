**Sleep Study Prior Authorization Policy**

**Procedure Overview**

* Procedure Name: Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)
* CPT Code: 95810
* Clinical Description:
The MSLT is a diagnostic test used to evaluate excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in individuals suspected of having a sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea. The test measures the time it takes for an individual to fall asleep during multiple naps throughout the day.

**Coverage Criteria**

To be eligible for coverage, the following criteria must be met:

1. **Conservative Treatment Requirements**: The patient must have received at least 12 weeks of physical therapy for symptoms related to musculoskeletal pain or stiffness, as diagnosed by a primary care physician.
2. **Symptom Duration Requirements**: The patient must have experienced excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) for a minimum of 6 weeks, with a total of 4 or more episodes of EDS per day.
3. **Clinical Documentation Required**:
	* A comprehensive medical history, including symptoms and treatment history
	* A physical examination, including vital signs and muscle strength assessments
	* Diagnostic test results, including sleep study reports (MSLT)
	* Treatment logs, documenting all therapies received for the past 12 weeks
4. **Imaging Requirements**: The patient must have undergone a recent imaging study (MRI or CT scan) of the spine within the last 6 months to rule out spinal cord compression or other structural abnormalities.
5. **Severity Criteria**:
	* Patient-reported pain scales must be 7 or higher on a 10-point scale
	* Functional assessments, such as the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), must have a score of 30% or higher

**Medical Necessity Criteria**

To determine medical necessity, the following criteria must be met:

1. **Patient Selection Criteria**: The patient must meet the diagnostic criteria for sleep apnea or narcolepsy, as defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).
2. **Failed Prior Treatments**: The patient must have failed at least 12 weeks of conservative treatment for symptoms related to musculoskeletal pain or stiffness.
3. **Contraindications to Conservative Care**: The patient must be unable to tolerate physical therapy due to severe comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or respiratory failure.

**Exclusion Criteria**

The following conditions will exclude coverage:

1. **Active Infections**: The patient must not have an active infection (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection)
2. **Pregnancy**: If applicable, the patient must be postpartum for at least 6 weeks
3. **Severe Comorbidities**: The patient must not have severe comorbidities that would contraindicate the test (e.g., cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure)
4. **Lack of Conservative Treatment**: The patient must have received adequate conservative treatment for symptoms related to musculoskeletal pain or stiffness
5. **Cosmetic Indications**: The sleep study is only approved for treating excessive daytime sleepiness caused by a legitimate medical condition and not for cosmetic purposes.

**Documentation Requirements**

To support prior authorization, the following documentation must be provided:

1. **History and Physical Examination**: A comprehensive medical history, including symptoms and treatment history, as well as a physical examination, including vital signs and muscle strength assessments
2. **Diagnostic Test Results**: Sleep study reports (MSLT) with results of 10% or higher on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)
3. **Treatment Logs**: Documentation of all therapies received for the past 12 weeks, including physical therapy sessions
4. **Specialist Consultations**: Letters from primary care physicians and specialists (e.g., pulmonologists, neurologists) supporting the need for a sleep study
